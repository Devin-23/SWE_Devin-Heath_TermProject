I made 20+ GitHUb repos trying to get this to work...
But seems like this is finally working now and hopfully wont have to make anymore.
In doing so though we've lost roughly 4-5 updates along the way...

But here is our SWE Term Project "App for the Institute of the South Pacific"

None of the files given on D2L will work, I cannot load them as they seem to be built for MacOS? idk the only text is shows is "MacOSX" and every fix i've tried from google just won't work...
So majority of this is being self taught from Google as the notes are also **very** difficult to follow...

update - I don't think the "push" function is working properly? will hopefully fidn out tommorrow after sleeping on it

update - not sleepinging on it, trying to figure out but apparently all updates that where pushed/sent have not been put in??? confused...

update - It was working and then it wasn't... either way the fianl version should be there. Can't seem to figure out how to set it as the default but you should be able to see what one was most recently added.
