I made 20+ GitHUb repos trying to get this to work...
But seems like this is finally working now and hopfully wont have to make anymore.
In doing so though we've lost roughly 4-5 updates along the way...

But here is our SWE Term Project "App for the Institute of the South Pacific"

update - I don't think the "push" function is working properly? will hopefully fidn out tommorrow after sleeping on it

update - not sleepinging on it, trying to figure out but apparently all updates that where pushed/sent have not been put in??? confused...
